Code for comparing ESNs (low spectral radius and high spectral radius) vs D2R2

ESNplothidden generates figure 2

ESN_N and ESN_varyf generate figures 3 and 4

ESN_LorenzQuadRegressv2 generates figure 5

ESN_NonQuad generated figure 6 (right, modified Chua)

utils.py generates figure 6 (left) and all remaining figures and all tables (except asymptotic/FLOPs cost table)
